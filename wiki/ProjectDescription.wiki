= Lucene IR Improvement =

The mail goal of the project is the improvement of Lucene project, which is an Retrival Information application, Open Source under Apache Licence.
The modifications are based on the _java_ version however there are other versions in different programming languages.
The based version for the modifications is 2.9.0 release on September 25th which by the way included several changes from the previous version 2.4.1 (9 March 2009).
The modifications include the modification of the inverted index format to include more parameters to be used in the computation of ranking formulas.

This project starts from a request of another project, which is BM25 (for documents without fields) and BM25F (for documents with structure (fields)), you can see more detail about this in http://nlp.uned.es/~jperezi/Lucene-BM25.

Basically, the target of the modifications is to improve the ranking feature of Lucene to determine how important a document is for a given query that is built on a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) and the Boolean model of Information Retrieval. The main idea behind VSM approach is the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all the documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query. Lucene uses also the Boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of boolean logic in the query specification.

= Information given by Lucene currently and which would be needed =

Information needed by the formulas:
 * df(t): number of documents where appears the term "t"
 * ld: document length
 * lc: field length
 * avl(c): average length of a field c
 * N: number of documents
