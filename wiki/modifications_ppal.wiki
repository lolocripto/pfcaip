= Specification of the Modifications in Lucene Project =

All the changes have been flagged with comments on an certain format to track the changes made from the "public" version, also, important comments made after detailed investigation/execution of the source code have been flagged too, the "flag" has been introduced in source code as "comments" (either with "//" or "/`*`"), the format of those comments are:

        * "AIP change code: comment of the change made and why"
        * "AIP comment: comment about what the code does in that part" 

For the nature of the modifications, the affected package is mainly "org.apache.lucene.index". There are a few changes on "org.apache.lucene.search" as well, to lists the changes you can make a search with the previous comments (AIP flag). 

This project starts from a request of another project, which is BM25 (for documents without fields) and BM25F (for documents with structure (fields)), you can see more detail about this in http://nlp.uned.es/~jperezi/Lucene-BM25.

Basically, the target of the modifications is to improve the ranking feature of Lucene to determine how important a document is for a given query that is built on a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) and the Boolean model of Information Retrieval. The main idea behind VSM approach is the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all the documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query. Lucene uses also the Boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of boolean logic in the query specification.

= Information is given by Lucene currently and which would be needed =

Information needed by the formulas:
 * df(t): number of documents where appears the term "t"
 * ld: document length
 * lc: field length
 * avl(c): average length of a field c
 * N: number of documents
